# xCall Scaffolding

This repository showcases examples of dApps that integrate with xCall, ICON's arbitrary cross-chain call service standard.

## Prerequisites

xCall is currently deployed in several testnets networks for different chains so you can directly deploy your dApp contracts to these networks.

The following repo keeps all the information related to the xCall deployment in these chains:

https://github.com/iconloop/btp2-testnet

You can also create a local development environment by deploying local chains, connect them via xCall and tests your dApp contracts.

For setting up a development environment for xCall you can choose one of the following options.

* BTP2 e2edemo - [repo](https://github.com/icon-project/btp2/tree/main/e2edemo) / [Tutorial](https://docs.icon.community/build-with-xcall/quickstart/setting-up-a-local-environment)

*  DIVE - [repo](https://github.com/HugoByte/DIVE) / [Tutorial](https://www.xcall.dev/quickstart/setting-up-a-local-environment-with-dive-cli)

## Build and Test

Each directory represents xCall integrations for specific blockchain networks. Please navigate to a network subdirectory to see more details on building and testing.
